# Why?

This project was initiated as ESLint and `typescript-eslint` teams [decided to deprecate formatting/stylistic-related rules](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522) from their core due to the maintenance cost. This project ports those rules and distributes them as separate packages. We will keep them maintained as the community.
